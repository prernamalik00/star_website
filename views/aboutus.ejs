          Every organisation and group has its own story and vision that propels
          it to move forward. The Alumni Cell of any educational institute has a
          pre-eminent aspect, to bridge in the gap of connection and
          communication between its students and the Alumni. Once a student
          becomes alumni, we connect them back to their institute.
          <br />
          The 'Students Team for Alumni Relations' also known as 'STAR', found
          its envisioning and need as early as the foundation of UIET in 2002.
          It wasn't until March of 2013, that it was officially founded. Our
          team, which started with a few members, now has 30 active teammates
          who work under the leadership of staff members that strive to give the
          best to our Alumni.
