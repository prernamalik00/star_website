      <strong>Student Mentorship Programme</strong> is a novel initiative
      undertaken by STAR, UIET, with the aim to enable positive and constructive
      interaction through the guidance provided by our Alumni to the Students.
      Here, the much more experienced alumni facilitate the guidance and support
      for the development of the students with their experience. This
      mentor-mentee relationship provides developmental opportunities for both
      the parties involved.

      In the Student Mentorship Program, Alumni from across the globe would come
      forward to help the students who seek to follow a similar path as them.
      This program is conducted at all levels of years and for various
      departments. The mentors would guide the students regarding their modes to
      study, exam preparation, the application process, job opportunities, their
      area of interest, and many more as such. Herein the mentors would
      contribute to the program by imparting their knowledge and experience in
      that particular area of interest to the student. This would allow the
      mentees to enhance and broaden their knowledge of a subject and would
      create a dynamic and creative learning experience.
